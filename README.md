# Programmazione-ad-Oggetti-Julien-e-Ivan
Here we will write every single changes of our program files... so don't forget!! 

Day 1:  14/06/19  coder:Ivan
----------------------------
This morning I completed the class for decoding JSON URL for getting the CSV file from it...
Now I need to do the parsing of data by creating data structures which each elements is equal to a class object(?)..
I think that we need to ask the teacher about this part because is very confusing...
After that, I think that Julien can start programming.

Day 2:  19/06/19 coder: Ivan
----------------------------
Today I've made some changes on the previous code, by adding some queries and comments on it. After that I started by creating some classes for mine second part.. the one for parsing datastructure but there are still some bug on it that i need absolutely to improve and after that it comes the julien part... and when he will finish that, we will together do the filters code... so stay tuned!
