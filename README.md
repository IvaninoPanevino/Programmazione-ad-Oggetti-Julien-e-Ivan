Day 1:  14/06/19  coder:Ivan
----------------------------
This morning I completed the class for decoding JSON URL for getting the CSV file from it...
Now I need to do the parsing of data by creating data structures which each elements is equal to a class object(?)..
I think that we need to ask the teacher about this part because is very confusing...
After that, I think that Julien can start programming.
